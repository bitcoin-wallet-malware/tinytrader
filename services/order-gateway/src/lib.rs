//! The order gateway: a broker-access passthrough for one broker account over the
//! `tinytrader.gateway/1` loopback NDJSON protocol (`README.md`).
//!
//! The account session validates, forwards and correlates client requests, journals
//! every event before delivery, never resends an ambiguous submit, and resolves unknown
//! outcomes by lookup. Brokers sit behind the synchronous [`broker::Broker`] seam: the
//! Alpaca paper broker ([`AlpacaPaper`]) and the simulated broker ([`SimBroker`]). No
//! strategy or portfolio lives here.
